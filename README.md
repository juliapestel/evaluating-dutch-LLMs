# Evaluating Dutch Large Language Models

This project is a work in progress. 

This project will cover the technical aspects of the paper "Evaluating the Dutch Linguistic Knowledge of Large Language Models". It will include a dataset with minimal pairs to evaluate the Dutch linguistic knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Additionally, the scripts used in the paper to evaluate multiple LLMs will be made available.
