Hi! For my Bachelor thesis I am evaluating the Dutch linguistic knowledge of language models (LMs) 
and am looking for participants who have the time to fill out a Â±10 min survey. I am looking for 
adult native speakers of Dutch who currently live in the Netherlands and don't have any language problems 
(such as dyslexia). If you have the time, it would be much appreciated if you would be willing to 
participate in my research. Thank you in advance!
